        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Like the title says, welcome to our little town of Damascus! Although little,
          there are quite a number of things to do and I've taken the liberty of
          organizing them all into the section tabs you see above.
        </p>

        <p>
          The area currently known as Damascus was granted by the new U.S. state of Maryland to Nathaniel Pigman in 1783. On February 14, 1819, War of 1812 veteran Edward Hughes bought a 40-acre (160,000 m2) section of the grant and began subdividing lots for sale. James Madison, the fourth U.S. president, appointed Hughes postmaster of the developing community of Damascus in 1816.
        </p>

        <p>
Damascus is located at the intersection of two major roads in upper Montgomery County: Ridge Road (currently Rt. 27) and Damascus Road (currently Rt. 108). Hughes received permission from Congress for a postal route through the town. Hughes called his town "The Pleasant Plains of Damascus" after Damascus, Syria. A newspaper in Frederick wrote of Hughes's growing town: "There is at this place an extensive opening for mechanics of all the different kinds, and it bids fair to improve very fast; ... There is at present two blacksmith shops, a saddler's shop and a store in the place -- a tailor, a wheel wright, and a shoemaker are much wanted, and would meet with great encouragement." This was the Damascus of 1816. The new township drew settlers from Anne Arundel County as well as from Montgomery County. On September 12, 1862, U.S. Army troops marched through the "village" of Damascus via what is now Route 27 on their way to the town of Sharpsburg, where they engaged Confederate troops commanded by General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Antietam.        </p>

        <p>
          The climate in this area is characterized by warm, humid summers and generally cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Damascus has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[4]
          Due to its higher elevation and northern location in Montgomery County, its 32-inch average snowfall is the highest in the county and the immediately adjacent Washington D.C. suburbs. In the record-breaking winter of 2009-2010, 98.4 inches of snow fell and a maximum depth of 37 inches was recorded, the greatest snow depth in the area's history. Occasionally intense blizzards fed by coastal waters can paralyze the area. In average winters, snow-covered ground comes and goes. In more severe winters, ponds may stay frozen and the ground will remain snow-covered for a month or two.
        </p>

        <p>
Damascus High School (DHS) is well-known regionally and nationally for its championship athletic teams, known as the Swarmin' Hornets. Damascus High School is one of the few remaining schools in the state to still hold its graduation ceremonies on the school's football field. A rite of passage for many graduating seniors is to walk on the field and receive their diploma not only in front of family and friends in the stands but also the several hundred townspeople who gather outside the fences to watch the ceremony. For the past few years the school has considered moving the ceremony to an alternate indoor location such as McDaniel College, but it has been voted down every year by the Senior class and their families. In the case of inclement weather, the graduation ceremony is held in the high school's auditorium.        </p>

          Fun fact: Due to its higher elevation and northern location in Montgomery County, its 32-inch average snowfall is the highest in the county and the immediately adjacent Washington D.C. suburbs. In the record-breaking winter of 2009-2010, 98.4 inches of snow fell and a maximum depth of 37 inches was recorded, the greatest snow depth in the area's history. Occasionally intense blizzards fed by coastal waters can paralyze the area. In average winters, snow-covered ground comes and goes. In more severe winters, ponds may stay frozen and the ground will remain snow-covered for a month or two.
