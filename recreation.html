              "Our Farm Market started under an apple tree behind the log house selling peaches.
              Later, it moved to a former chicken house that still stands on the property as a garage.
              The red barn was built in 1964 and over the years we increased the variety of seasonal
              fruits and vegetables we grew and sold. In the 1970’s, we began selling additional products
              in our Farm Market, including preserves, local honey, gourmet condiments, seasonal decorative
              items, cider, and more! In 1993, we outgrew our original red barn and expanded the Farm Market
              to the current facility that you can visit today."

            <p>
              In 1992, Damascus UMC Pastor Jim Archibald formed a committee to determine if a thrift shop was feasible.
              Bill Harwood, a church member and former employee of Goodwill Industries, had the expertise to transform ideas into reality.
              The decision was made to house the shop in the basement of the former church. The Damascus Thrift Shop opened for business on
              Thursday, March 11, 1993. Bill Harwood guided the shop over the rough spots that first year. In June 1996 the operation moved
              upstairs in the same building. The name of the shop was changed to Harwood House, to honor the founder.
